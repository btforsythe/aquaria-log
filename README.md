Plants arrived.

## Friday/Saturday, 2017-07-21-22

Started dosing 9g shrimp tank.

- 15 drops Flourish Iron
- 20 drops Flourish Excel

Decided to dose Flourish Iron daily (rather than twice/week) on the 29g.

Added shrimp from Rivers to Reefs Friday, they started dying pretty much straightaway. What are R2R's water parameters?
