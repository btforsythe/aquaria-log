Plants arrived.

Started dosing 9g shrimp tank.

Initial dose:
- 30 drops Flourish
- 30 drops Flourish Iron
- 100 drops Flourish Excel

Planned dosing:
- 15 drops Flourish
- 15 drops Flourish Iron
- 20 drops Flourish Excel

Decided to dose Flourish Iron daily (rather than twice/week) on the 29g.

Added shrimp from Rivers to Reefs Friday, they started dying pretty much straightaway. What are R2R's water parameters?
