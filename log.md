## Thursday, 2017-07-20

Plants arrived.

## Friday/Saturday, 2017-07-21-22

Started dosing 9g shrimp tank.

Initial dose:
- 30 drops Flourish
- 30 drops Flourish Iron
- 100 drops Flourish Excel

Planned dosing:
- 15 drops Flourish
- 15 drops Flourish Iron
- 20 drops Flourish Excel

Decided to dose Flourish Iron daily (rather than twice/week) on the 29g.

Added shrimp from Rivers to Reefs Friday, they started dying pretty much straightaway. What are R2R's water parameters?

## Wed, July 26th, 2017

Added 2 Flourish tabs to 9g, added 3 to 29g.

## Thurs, July 27th, 2017

29g:
- nirite: maybe some (?) measurable amount
- nitrate: almost unmeasurable as well

## Fri, July 29th, 2017

29g:
- added about two gallons water to replace evaporation (without adding Prime, must have left it at home)
- added 1.2 ml Flourish Nitrogen

## Mon, July 31st, 2017

29g: added 7.5ml Flourish Nitrogen as per Seachem dosing calculator for 2 mg/L of nitrogen in 15g of water

29g: water change, 2g + top off: +2g

## Tuesday, Aug 22, 2017

29g: phosphate 0.1-0.2ppm. Same for 9g, gonna assume that's about as low as it will measure/baseline.

## Tuesday, 2017-12-05

Received plants from [LiveAquaria](http://www.liveaquaria.com). I ordered:
- 4 x Cryptocoryne spiralis: This were large, nice plants, think I received 5?

### target water parameters (from [Discobee's Dwarf Shrimp water parameters](https://www.discobee.com/blogs/news/17030569-dwarf-shrimp-water-parameters) entry for Red Cherry Shrimp)

Looks like temperature may be a bit bogus?

|PH			|KH		|GH		|TDS		|Temperature
|---		|---	|---	|---		|---
|6.4–7.6	|2–5	|6–8	|150–250	|69-74

### 29g

#### water tests (before water change)

|nitrate								|GH     |KH
|---									|---	|---
|almost unmeasurable (is my kit good?)	|6-7°	|off the charts! (oopsie)

- changed 2 gallons water, swapped out and cleaned powerhead sponge filters and canister prefilter

### tap water

#### water tests (before water change)

TDS meter seems a bit dodgy? (Readings change whenever I swish it around)

|TDS        |

|750-760ppm |


## 2018-09-05

### 29g

|TDS    |pH |GH |Notes
|---    |---|---|---
|710ppm |9.0|6-7|is a pH of 9 even possible?
